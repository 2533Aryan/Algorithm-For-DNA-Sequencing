# Algorithm-For-DNA-Sequencing

This course introduces computational methods -- algorithms and data structures -- for analyzing DNA sequencing data. We will learn about DNA, genomics, and how DNA sequencing is used.  

We will use Python to implement key algorithms and data structures and to analyze real genomes and DNA sequencing datasets.

# Overview:

- DNA sequencing, strings, and matching.

- Preprocessing, indexing, and approximate matching.

- Edit distance, assembly, overlap.

- Algorithms for assembly.


This course roughly follows topics covered in the textbook Algorithms for Next-Generation Sequencing Data: Techniques, Approaches, and Applications by Mourad Elloumi.
